# release/guard

The SC-VERSIONING and SC-DISTRIBUTION guards `ci.yml`'s `guardrail` job runs on every push,
pull request and tag push.

- `tag-prefix.sh <tag>` — SC-VERSIONING: a release tag's path prefix must equal this
  module's path from the repo root. language-tools carries exactly one Go module, at the
  repo root itself, so that path is empty and the required tag is a bare `[v]X.Y.Z` —
  unlike a monorepo module, which tags `<path>/[v]X.Y.Z`.
- `no-committed-binaries.sh [root]` — SC-DISTRIBUTION: no built binary may be committed to
  this tree; every per-OS/arch artifact ships through `release.yml` (CD) instead. Unlike
  ai-shared-lib's `build-helpers` module, language-tools carries no darwin-arm64
  last-resort exception — a CI runner cross-compiles every target for this repo (Go's
  cross-compilation needs no native arm64-macOS hardware), so no committed-binary path was
  ever needed here.

Both scripts are stdlib-shell, no install: run directly from a checkout.

```sh
bash release/guard/tag-prefix.sh v1.2.3
bash release/guard/no-committed-binaries.sh .
```

Exit codes: 0 conforms; 1 a violation was found; 2 usage error.
