# per-OS/arch artifact ships through release.yml (CD) instead, so a
# committed executable is always a defect here — unlike ai-shared-lib's
# build-helpers, language-tools carries no darwin-arm64 last-resort
# exception: a CI runner cross-compiles every target for this repo, so no
# committed-binary path was ever needed.
#
# A candidate is a git-tracked file whose tracked mode is executable
# (100755) and whose leading bytes contain a NUL — the same signal git's
# own diff machinery uses to call a blob "binary".
